ORIGINAL QUESTION NAME: Q1945
 
NOT COUNTING ANY MONEY YOU RECEIVED FROM YOUR MILITARY SERVICE.../
DURING 1990, HOW MUCH DID YOU RECEIVE FROM WAGES, SALARY,
COMMISSIONS, OR TIPS FROM ALL (OTHER) JOBS, BEFORE DEDUCTIONS FOR
TAXES OR ANYTHING ELSE?
 
NOTE: TRUNCATED VALUES ARE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE VALUE OF ALL
RESPONDENTS WHO ARE U.S. RESIDENTS AND WHO HAVE VALUES EXCEEDING THE
TRADITIONAL TRUNCATION LEVEL OF 100,001 FOR THIS ITEM. PERSONS WITH
OUT-OF-RANGE CODE 999,996 WERE ASSIGNED THIS VALUE AS AN APPROXIMATION.
SINCE PERSONS WITH OUT-OF-RANGE CODES HAVE VALUES GREATER THAN THIS
CODE, OUR AVERAGE FOR TOP-CODED RESPONDENTS WILL BE TOO LOW TO THE
EXTENT THAT OUT-OF-RANGE CODES ARE PRESENT IN THE RAW DATA. OVERSEAS
RESPONDENTS WHOSE DOLLAR INCOME COULD NOT BE DETERMINED ARE CODED -3.

During 1995, how much did you receive from wages, salary, commissions, or tips 
from all (other) jobs, before deductions for taxes or anything else?
 
NOTE: TRUNCATED VALUES ARE APPLIED TO THE TOP APPROXIMATELY 2 PERCENT OF 
RESPONDENTS WITH VALID NON-MISSING RESPONSES. THE LOWEST VALUE FOR THE TOP 2 
PERCENT OF CASES IS USED AS THE TRUNCATION LEVEL ($83,500 FOR THIS VARIABLE). 
VALUES FOR ALL CASES AT OR OVER THAT LEVEL ARE AVERAGED. THAT AVERAGE IS THEN 
ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THE TOP 2 PERCENT OF CASES. OVERSEAS RESPONDENTS WHOSE 
DOLLAR INCOME COULD NOT BE DETERMINED ARE CODED -3.
Revised topcode.  Top 2% of values are replaced with the group average.

During 2001, how much did you receive from wages, salary, commissions, or tips 
from all (other) jobs, before deductions for taxes or anything else?
NOTE:  TRUNCATED VALUES ARE APPLIED TO THE TOP APPROXIMATELY 2 PERCENT OF 
RESPONDENTS WITH VALID NON-MISSING RESPONSES.  THE LOWEST VALUE FOR THE TOP 2 
PERCENT OF CASES IS USED AS THE TRUNCATION LEVEL ($130,000 FOR THIS VARIABLE).  
VALUES FOR ALL CASES AT OR OVER THAT LEVEL ARE AVERAGED.  THAT AVERAGE IS THEN 
ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THE TOP 2 PERCENT OF CASES.  OVERSEAS RESPONDENTS WHOSE 
DOLLAR INCOME COULD NOT BE DETERMINED ARE CODED -3.
