# Refresh the wages data
This will be a repo for a summer 2020/2021 project re-building, and documenting the process of the wages data from the NLSY

## Overall goal 

Produce a clean data set for demonstrating the brolgar package, with all steps documented to go from database to final clean set.

Data provided generally as a R package to be submitted to CRAN.

## Steps

**Milestone 1**
- Exploratory analysis of current tidied data
- Follow brolgar paper parts https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01619 (Will provide code files)
- Also examine relationshio with gender, age, education

**Milestone 2**
- Create subset of only high school drop outs
- Small examples illustrating difference between this cohort and all others

**Milestone 3**
- Work through the full instructions for getting the data
- Document the process into a report format

**Milestone 4**
- Create package structure and repo: could we call it "yowie"??
- Document data (using roxygen)
- Create small examples of usage into a vignette
- Read https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013/RJ-2013-012/RJ-2013-012.pdf for how to document data in R
