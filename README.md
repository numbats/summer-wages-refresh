# Refresh the wages data
This will be a repo for a summer 2020/2021 project re-building, and documenting the process of the wages data from the NLSY

## Overall goal 

Produce a clean data set for demonstrating the brolgar package, with all steps documented to go from database to final clean set.

Data provided generally as a R package to be submitted to CRAN.

## Steps

- Exploratory analysis of current tidied data
- Follow brolgar paper parts https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01619 (Will provide code files)
- Maybe, create subset to number of individuals with reasonably complete records, and summarise these to get started.
