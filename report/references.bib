abstract = {Abstract Initial data analysis is conducted independently of the analysis needed to address the research questions. Shortcomings in these first steps may result in inappropriate statistical methods or incorrect conclusions. We outline a framework for initial data analysis and illustrate the impact of initial data analysis on research studies. Examples of reporting of initial data analysis in publications are given. A systematic and careful approach to initial data analysis is needed as good research practice.},

abstract = {The initial examination of data (abbreviated IDA) is a valuable stage of most statistical investigations, not only for scrutinizing and summarizing data, but also for model formulation. Several examples are presented to illustrate the benefits of IDA, particularly that IDA may be all that is necessary or desirable. In particular, a re-analysis of the notorious teaching styles data produces completely different conclusions to earlier studies. A critical comparison is made between IDA and Tukey's exploratory data analysis approach. Some reasons why IDA is often neglected or undervalued are discussed and countered. Some implications for the teaching of Statistics are considered.},
