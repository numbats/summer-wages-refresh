abstract = {In this book, [the authors] use concrete examples and careful explanation to demonstrate how research questions about change and event occurrence can be addressed with longitudinal data. In doing so, [they] reveal research opportunities unavailable in the world of cross-sectional data. ... The book is divided into two major parts: individual growth modelling in the first half, survival analysis in the second. Throughout each half, [are stressed] the important connections between the methods. Each half has its own introduction that 1) discusses when the method might be used; 2) distinguishes among the different types of research questions in that domain and 3) identifies the major statistical features of empirical studies that lend themselves to the specified analyses. Both types of analyses require a sensible metric for clocking time. But in growth modelling ... multiple waves of data [are needed] and an outcome that changes systematically whereas in survival analysis, [the reader] must clearly identify the beginning of time and the criteria used to assess event occurrence. Subsequent chapters in each half of the book walk [the reader] through the details of analysis. Each begins with a chapter on data description and exploratory analysis, followed by a detailed discussion of model specification, model fitting, and parameter interpretation. Having introduced a basic model, [the authors] consider extensions. Because it is easier to understand the path that winds through the book only after important issues relevant for each half have been introduced, [they] defer discussion of each half's outline to its associated introductory chapter.
